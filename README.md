# Hello all CPE 202 members!

From what I have heard, many of you are worried about the common final, so I decided to make a few practice problems that members from other classes will be doing.
In order to get started with this, all you need to type is:
```
git clone https://github.com/joeb15/202Problems
```
If you have any problems, go to [Issues Page](https://github.com/joeb15/202Problems/issues) and submit a new issue.

If you need any more information, or would like a different kind of practice problem, contact me:

## Notes about this repo:
1. Each main folder is a topic
2. Each sub folder is a way of approaching the topic (sub-topic)
3. Each sub folder will contain:
    * **_test.py**  
    This will contain some unittests that I wrote, to run them, type:  
    python3 xxxxxx_test.py  

    * **_complete.py**  
    This will contain a complete and working version of the code, try not to open this unless you want spoilers  
    Each Line is commented to say exactly what is going on in that step, and will contain different variants that also work

    * **.py**  
    This is the actual file that you will be programming.  
    Each file will contain a shell of code for you to fill in.  
    Each method will be commented to contain what you are supposed to do in that method, as well as any return or error cases
    
    * **README.md**  
    This is a file that contains information about the type of topic you are working on.  
    This should be viewed using GitHub.com or a web browser in order to see the correct formatting.  
    May contain useful resources regarding the topic, so view these before asking for help.

4. Have fun with these, coding is not meant to be depressing, its meant to empower the user to complete amazing tasks
