#Hello all CPE 202 members!
From what I have heard, many of you are worried about the common final, so I decided to make a few practice problems that members from other classes will be doing.
In order to get started with this, all you need to type is:

>git clone https://github.com/joeb15/202Problems

If you have any problems, go to [Issues Page](https://github.com/joeb15/202Problems/issues) and submit a new issue.

If you need any more information, or would like a different kind of practice problem, contact me:
>Phone: (412) 552-8126
>Email: jvbanko@calpoly.edu
